# Recipe App (SwiftUI)

## üìù Project Aim
The goal of this project is to **get started with iOS development**, learn key **SwiftUI concepts**, and build a **fully-featured app** from scratch. This app will cover authentication, API integration, local storage, notifications, multimedia handling, and advanced iOS features like Dynamic Island and Live Activities.

This project will serve as a **learning journey**, while producing a real, production-ready app.

## üí° Notes
- This project is **learning-focused** ‚Äî each feature is a way to understand SwiftUI and iOS development patterns.
- I'm going to use firebase firestore database for quicker backend implementation.
- By the end of this project, I aim to **have a fully functional, production-ready Recipe App** built entirely in SwiftUI.
